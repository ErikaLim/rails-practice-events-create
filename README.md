# Rails Practice - Creating events

You are creating some event tracking software. Your task is to be able to create some events and then see the list of them.
For now, don't worry styling, just the functionality.

Events have:
* a date
* a description
* whether the event requires an ID
* capacity
* directions to the event

You will need to handroll the controllers, views, models, migrations and routes to make this happen!
